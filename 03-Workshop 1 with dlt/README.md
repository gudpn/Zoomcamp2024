# DLT library 🧙‍♂️

## Overview
This README provides a comprehensive guide for setting up the jupyter notebook environment for workshop 1 Homework. In this exercise, jupyter notebook is used. 


## Preparation  🪄
Please make sure you have already installed the following lib.

You can run the python script or the notebook script.
